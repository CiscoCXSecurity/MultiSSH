##Description:##
this is a tool for running multiple SSH connections at the same time. This application works best if run as root. It also works best if you have scapy installed. That beings said, it can work without either of those requirements.
##Usage:##
To start MultiSSH, type:
    sudo python ./multissh.py

Once you have launched it, type `help` to see the available commands.

##Issues:##
Hit me up on github if there are any issues. Also feel free to submit issues. I Probably wont respond to either....
